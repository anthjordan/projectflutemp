Third attempt
Final Data Analysis
* We reached a null hypothesis between the assumption of correlation between the susceptibility of the flu and fluctuations in temperature throughout the states. We specifically used the years 2016-2019 to keep the data remaining as current as possible while also remaining pre-pandemic as to rule out any assumed loss in data accuracy. API data was pulled from(data:https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) to reference the temperature and the flu data was pulled from (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm)
* Visual aids to this conclusion are visualized in the charts and graphs located in our slide deck. They include a histogram, bar graph, a quartile graph, and regression analysis.
